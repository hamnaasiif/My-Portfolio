## About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at FAST-NUCES with a focused interest in frontend development and user interface design. My foundation lies in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React, with practical experience building responsive, component-based interfaces.

Beyond the frontend, I've explored systems and backend development using C++ and Python through projects like a compiler, a GUI-based operating system, and a hybrid P2P communication app. Currently, I'm expanding into the MERN stack and computer vision to broaden my capabilities.
